## About Sweet Project Wordlists

These wordlists were collected via the **Sweet Project Honeypot**, a lightweight WordPress plugin I created and customized to quickly turn a WordPress site into a honeypot. The plugin’s source code will be published in the coming weeks/months.

From now on, I plan to publish **only two types of data**:
- a **password wordlist** 
- a **URL list** 

These lists are the result of roughly **two months of continuous automated attacks**. They are therefore relatively recent and may be useful for **defensive security** tasks such as auditing, threat research, blue team testing, and detection engineering.

## Available lists

For now, I’m only publishing the **password list**, available at: [passwords.txt](Passwords.txt)

## Future updates

In future releases, the lists may be **split and classified** based on the technology/services they appear to target (e.g., WordPress, CMS panels, admin paths, common services).

## Filtering and privacy

The lists are **deduplicated** to keep only unique entries.

In addition, I performed a **manual review** to remove entries that could contain personal or identifying information (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers, or strings that clearly reference specific accounts or websites).

If you still spot content that could harm someone or should not be here, please **contact me** and I will remove it.

## Responsible Disclosure / Takedown

This repository is intended **exclusively for defensive security research and authorized testing** (e.g., auditing, detection engineering, threat analysis, and controlled red team exercises with explicit permission). It is **not** intended to facilitate unauthorized access, credential stuffing, or any other illegal activity.

All published content is provided in a **minimized and decontextualized format**, and is **deduplicated** and reviewed to reduce the risk of including personal or identifying information.

If any entry is found to contain sensitive, personal, or identifying data, or if any content is believed to pose a privacy or safety risk, it will be **promptly removed** from the public dataset and excluded from future releases.
